            My name is Elijah Davis. I am a 21 years old and a up incoming web
            developer. In the past I have experience with construction and
            autoCAD. AutoCAD really is what got me interested in the idea of
            coding. I've always been pretty good with computers and enjoyed
            working with them so I thought coding might be for me. One of my
            biggest reasons for wanting to learn coding is because I love
            traveling and the idea of moving to a foreign country and a job I
            could work remotely and not full time is very appealing to me. My
            favorite coding laungage so far is javascript because I like the
            logic of it and breaking things down very simply so the computer can
            understand.

            In my free time I really enjoy being outside and being active. I
            love surfing, exercising, and lots of sports. Some of my favorite
            sports are volleyball and basketball. I play basketball with my
            friends and enjoy playing a more aggressive position.
